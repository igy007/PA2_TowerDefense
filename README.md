<b>Tower Defense</b>

A Tower Defense type game made as a project for "Programování a Algoritmizace 2" course at FIT CTU using C++ and ncurses library.

To run this "game", g++ compiler and ncurses library need to be present on your OS.
Your terminal also needs to support color.

For compilation, simply downloaded the repository data, navigate into the folder with makefile using terminal and type "make".

Tested on various Mac OS X versions (.10, .13) and Linux distros (Debian, Ubuntu 20.04)

To obtain ncurses library for Linux in case that it's missing in your OS, use the following command:
**sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev**
